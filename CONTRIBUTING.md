## 🚦 Development Workflow and Rules

### 🔐 Protected Branches

- The `main` branch is **protected**.
- **Direct pushes to `main` are not allowed**.
- All changes must go through a **Pull Request (PR)**.
- **Each PR requires at least one approval** before it can be merged.

### 👥 For Collaborators with Commit Access

- Please create a dedicated branch for your work (e.g., `feature/your-feature-name`).
- To propose changes, open a Pull Request targeting the `main` branch.
- PRs will be reviewed and merged by the repository maintainers.

### 🛠 Pull Request Workflow

1. Fork the repository (if you’re not a collaborator) or create a feature branch.
2. Make your changes in that branch.
3. Push the branch and open a Pull Request.
4. Wait for review and approval.
5. The maintainers will handle the merge.
